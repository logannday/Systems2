Plan of Improvement
-------------------

Luke Myers Critiques:
ls:
1. Add comments describing functionality of builtins throughout the code
2. Initialize pointers to NULL
3. Remove assignments from conditional expressions 
4. Assign buffer before conditional, then check if the operation worked in conditional

cp:
5. Move assignments out of conditionals
6. Dynamically allocate large buffers
7. Assign bytes read outside conditional

env:
Must have forgotton to paste this function in the  in progress functions

Sophia Mesquita Critique
1. I like strcmp() == 0, I think that's more explicit that !strcmp
2. Implement arg checking for env

Hidemi Critique
1. Fix longformat == operater
2. Change syscalls to use perror
3. Remove unused password call
4. Free buffer if syscall fails
5. Note, make sure cp is setting permissions correctly
6. Check bytes written against bytes read when copying file
7. Add missing curly brace
